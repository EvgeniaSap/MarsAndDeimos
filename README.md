# MarsAndDeimos
Visual model of the planet Mars and satellite Deimos in outer space. 

Developed in `C#` using an additional graphics library `OpenTK`.

The program organizes the movement and rotation of the image, the removal and approximation of graphic objects by pressing certain control keys.

## Building and running the project
1. Clone the repository
2. Move `Mars1.bmp`, `Deimos1.bmp`, `Myname1.bmp`, `Star1.bmp` files to `../bin/Degug/`
3. You can replace textures with others by setting the appropriate file name and resolution
## Using the project
Use the control key codes to move in space:
- key "UP ARROW" - zoom;
- key "DOWN ARROW" - move away;
- key "LEFT ARROW" - turn to the left;
- key "RIGHT ARROW" - turn to the right;
- key "END" - go up;
- key "INSERT" - go down.
